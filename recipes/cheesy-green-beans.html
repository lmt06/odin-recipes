    <p>Description</p>
    <p>A family favorite thanksgiving dish that basically only requires opeing
        a bag of green beans dumping on cheese then putting in the oven. Comes
        out of the oven tasting like it took three hours of prep! Perfect for the slacker
        cook this holiday season!
